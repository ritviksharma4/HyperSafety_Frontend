The HyperSafety Flutter Frontend of the [HyperSafety Backend](https://github.com/ViVek6301/HyperSafety_Backend) and the [HyperSafety ML Service](https://github.com/ritviksharma4/HyperSafety_Service), an Employee Management Project in which images and details of Employees can be uploaded, which would then
be used to detect whether or not Employees are wearing a mask in the Workplace. The HyperSafety Frontend can then be used by the Higher-ups to check which Employees have been caught without a mask.
